# Getting Started

This guide takes you through the public first-contact path: install Mesh, run hello-world, then choose the starter that matches what you want to evaluate next.

## Installation

Use the documented installer scripts to install both `meshc` and `meshpkg`. The staged release proof covers these installer targets:

- macOS `x86_64` and `arm64`
- Linux `x86_64` and `arm64` (GNU libc)
- Windows `x86_64`

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -sSf https://meshlang.dev/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows x86_64 (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://meshlang.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installers place both binaries in `~/.mesh/bin` on Unix-like systems and `~\.mesh\bin` on Windows.

### Verify the install

After installing, verify both binaries are available:

```bash
meshc --version
meshpkg --version
```

You should see the Mesh version number printed for each command.

### Alternative: Build from source

If you are contributing to Mesh or targeting an environment outside the public
installer coverage, build from source instead. A source build requires:

- a current Rust toolchain;
- LLVM 21, with `LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX` pointing to that installation when it is
  not discoverable automatically; and
- `clang` plus the linker and system libraries for the target you are building.

Then install both commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperpush-org/mesh-lang.git
cd mesh-lang
export LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm-21
cargo install --path compiler/meshc
cargo install --path compiler/meshpkg
```

The repository's default LLVM path targets Apple Silicon Homebrew. Override it
on Intel macOS, Linux, or Windows. Cross-compiling also needs a working target
linker and sysroot; `rustup target add` alone does not provide those native
tools.

## Hello World

Create a new Mesh project:

```bash
meshc init hello
cd hello
```

Open `main.mpl` and replace its contents with:

```mesh
fn main() do
  println("Hello, World!")
end
```

Compile and run it:

```bash
meshc build .
./output
```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed to the terminal.

When the project directory argument is `.`, the default executable name is
`output`. Use `meshc build . --output hello` when you want a named binary.

`main.mpl` remains the default executable entrypoint. If you need a different startup file later, use the optional `[package].entrypoint = "lib/start.mpl"` setting in `mesh.toml`.

## Choose your next starter

Once hello-world runs, pick the starter that matches your next job.

- `meshc init --clustered hello_cluster` — the minimal clustered starter. It keeps the public clustered-app contract small: `work.mpl` declares `@cluster`, `main.mpl` boots through `Node.start_from_env()`, and runtime inspection stays on Mesh-owned `meshc cluster status|continuity|diagnostics` commands.
- `meshc init --template todo-api --db sqlite todo_api` — the honest local-only starter. It is a single-node SQLite Todo API, keeps SQLite single-node only, includes actor-backed write rate limiting plus generated package tests, and makes no clustered placement or operator claims.
- `meshc init --template todo-api --db postgres shared_todo` — the serious shared/deployable PostgreSQL starter. It keeps clustered work source-first, uses migrations plus a real `DATABASE_URL`, clusters shared reads and idempotent `POST /todos`, keeps local health plus unsafe-keyless `PUT` and `DELETE` local, and owns the staged deploy + failover proof chain once you step onto the proof pages.

## What's Next?

Keep the public first-contact ladder explicit and ordered: clustered scaffold first, then the honest local SQLite starter, then the shared/deployable PostgreSQL starter, and finally the autonomous cluster and release-proof guides.

- [Clustered Example](/docs/getting-started/clustered-example/) -- the scaffold-first clustered tutorial using `meshc init --clustered`
- [SQLite Todo starter](https://github.com/hyperpush-org/mesh-lang/blob/main/examples/todo-sqlite/README.md) -- the honest local-only single-node Todo starter
- [PostgreSQL Todo starter](https://github.com/hyperpush-org/mesh-lang/blob/main/examples/todo-postgres/README.md) -- the serious shared/deployable Todo starter and the proof-page handoff for staged deploy + failover.
- [Packages and Registry](/docs/packages/) -- exact-version dependencies, lockfiles, publishing, and the shipped Borsh, Anchor, and Solana packages
- [Native Packages](/docs/native-packages/) -- manifest-gated `@native` bindings and checksummed static libraries
- [Autonomous Clusters](/docs/autonomous-clusters/) -- configure routing, continuity, and capacity drivers
- [Distributed Proof](/docs/distributed-proof/) -- run the self-contained Docker/PostgreSQL release proof

After that starter/examples-first ladder, continue with the language guides:

- [Language Basics](/docs/language-basics/) -- variables, types, functions, pattern matching, control flow, and more
- [Type System](/docs/type-system/) -- structs, sum types, generics, and type inference
- [Concurrency](/docs/concurrency/) -- actors, message passing, supervision, and services
