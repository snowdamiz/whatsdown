description: Write and run tests in Mesh with meshc test — assertions, grouping, mock actors, and receive expectations
---

# Testing

Mesh includes a first-class testing framework accessible via `meshc test`. Test files use the `.test.mpl` extension and can contain individual tests, grouped tests with shared setup/teardown, mock actors, and receive assertions.

> **Autonomous clusters:** This page covers testing primitives. Continue with [Distributed Proof](/docs/distributed-proof/) for the repository-owned integration, chaos, soak, and performance gates.

## Running Tests

```bash
meshc test my-app
meshc test my-app/tests
meshc test my-app/tests/config.test.mpl
meshc test --quiet my-app
```

`meshc test` discovers all `*.test.mpl` files under the requested project root or directory target, compiles and runs each independently, and prints a summary:

```
test arithmetic is correct ... ok
test string operations/length ... ok

2 tests, 0 failures
```

On failure, the output includes the failing assertion, the expected and actual values, and the file/test name. The exit code is non-zero if any test fails.

`--quiet` prints compact progress dots instead of every test name.

## Writing Tests

Test files are standalone `.test.mpl` programs. Each `test` block defines a named test:

```mesh
test("arithmetic is correct") do
  assert(1 + 1 == 2)
  assert_eq(10, 5 + 5)
  assert_ne(3, 4)
end

test("string operations") do
  assert(String.length("hello") == 5)
  assert_eq("hello", String.to_lower("HELLO"))
end
```

## Assertions

| Assertion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `assert expr` | Passes if `expr` is true; prints expression source and value on failure |
| `assert_eq a, b` | Passes if `a == b`; prints expected and actual on failure |
| `assert_ne a, b` | Passes if `a != b`; prints both values on failure |
| `assert_raises fn` | Passes if calling `fn` raises a runtime error |

```mesh
test("assertions") do
  assert(true)
  assert_eq(42, 40 + 2)
  assert_ne("hello", "world")
  assert_raises fn() do
    assert(false)
  end
end
```

## Grouping with describe

Use `describe` to group related tests. The group name appears in failure output:

```mesh
describe("string operations") do
  test("length") do
    assert(String.length("hello") == 5)
  end

  test("concat") do
    assert_eq("ab", "a" <> "b")
  end
end
```

Failed test output shows: `string operations/length ... FAIL`

## Setup and Teardown

`setup` and `teardown` blocks run before and after each test in a `describe` group:

```mesh
describe("counter") do
  setup do
    assert(true)   # runs before each test in this describe
  end

  teardown do
    assert(true)   # runs after each test in this describe
  end

  test("increments") do
    assert_eq(1, 0 + 1)
  end
end
```

`setup` and `teardown` are scoped to the `describe` block — they do not affect tests outside of it.

## Mock Actors

Use `Test.mock_actor` to spawn a lightweight actor owned by the current test:

```mesh
test("mock actor lifecycle") do
  let mock = Test.mock_actor(fn _message do
    "handled"
  end)
  send(mock, "hello")
end
```

`Test.mock_actor(fn(String) -> String)` returns a test-owned `Pid` you can send strings to. The helper checks for messages with a 100 ms idle timeout, ignores the callback's return value, and has no `"ok"`/`"stop"` control protocol. Mesh tracks mock PIDs and cleans them up between tests. Treat it as a lifecycle and cleanup helper; when message payload or callback behavior matters, define a normal actor in the test file and use `assert_receive` to verify observable messages.

## assert_receive

`assert_receive` waits for the current test actor to receive a message matching a pattern:

```mesh
test("receive a message") do
  let me = self()
  send(me, 42)
  assert_receive 42, 500   # pattern, timeout_ms
end
```

If the message is not received within the timeout, the test fails with the pattern and elapsed time. The default timeout is 100ms when omitted:

```mesh
assert_receive "done", 1000   # explicit timeout
```

## Coverage

Coverage requests are intentionally honest today:

```bash
meshc test --coverage my-app
```

`--coverage` currently exits non-zero with an explicit unsupported message instead of returning a stub report.

## What's Next?

- [Standard Library](/docs/stdlib/) — strings, collections, files, arithmetic, crypto, and time
- [Developer Tools](/docs/tooling/) — meshc, meshpkg, formatter, REPL, LSP
