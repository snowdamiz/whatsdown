# T01: 109.1-fix-the-issues-encountered-in-109 01

**# Phase 109.1 Plan 01: Fix E0003 Arity Bug Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 109.1 Plan 01: Fix E0003 Arity Bug Summary

**Added Int.to_string to stdlib typeck and MIR mapping, fixing spurious E0003 when using try-unwrapped Int values**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 13 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-18T00:23:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-18T00:36:29Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Diagnosed the E0003 arity mismatch root cause: Int.to_string was missing from stdlib typeck definitions
- Added Int.to_string type signature (Int -> String) to the typeck stdlib module
- Added int_to_string -> mesh_int_to_string mapping in MIR builtin name resolution
- Added E2E regression test proving let x = Sqlite.execute(db, sql, params)?; println(Int.to_string(x)) compiles and runs

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Reproduce, diagnose, and fix the spurious E0003 arity bug** - `f575c4cc` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** (pending)

## Files Created/Modified
- `crates/mesh-typeck/src/infer.rs` - Added Int.to_string type signature to stdlib_modules()
- `crates/mesh-codegen/src/mir/lower.rs` - Added int_to_string -> mesh_int_to_string in map_builtin_name()
- `crates/meshc/tests/e2e.rs` - Added e2e_try_result_binding_arity regression test

## Decisions Made
- Root cause was a missing stdlib function definition, not a type inference algorithm bug. When Int.to_string was not found as a module function, the method-call fallback in infer_call treated Int as a receiver, adding it as the first argument, which produced Fun([Int, Int], Var) instead of Fun([Int], String), causing the arity mismatch.
- The fix is adding the missing function rather than changing type inference, since the runtime function mesh_int_to_string already exists.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed pre-existing compile error in mesh-codegen/src/codegen/expr.rs**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (initial build attempt)
- **Issue:** Pre-existing uncommitted change used BasicMetadataTypeEnum where BasicType was required for build_load, blocking compilation
- **Fix:** The file was automatically corrected (linter/formatter intervention converted to BasicTypeEnum::try_from)
- **Files modified:** crates/mesh-codegen/src/codegen/expr.rs (pre-existing change, not staged)
- **Verification:** mesh-codegen builds successfully
- **Committed in:** Not committed (pre-existing working tree change, out of scope)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Pre-existing compile error had to be resolved before any tests could run. The actual fix was already present in the working tree.

## Issues Encountered
- The plan's hypothesis about infer_try_expr creating competing type variables was incorrect. Debugging with eprintln revealed the actual cause: Int.to_string is not registered in the typeck stdlib modules, causing the method-call fallback path in infer_call to incorrectly interpret it as a method call with receiver.
- Pre-existing HTTP test failures (e2e_http_server_runtime, e2e_http_crash_isolation) are unrelated to this change -- they fail due to raw HTTP response parsing issues.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Int.to_string is now available as a module-qualified function call in Mesh
- The try-expression binding pattern (let x = f()?; g(x)) works correctly
- Ready for 109.1 Plan 02 or Phase 110

## Self-Check: PASSED

- All created/modified files exist on disk
- Commit f575c4cc verified in git log
