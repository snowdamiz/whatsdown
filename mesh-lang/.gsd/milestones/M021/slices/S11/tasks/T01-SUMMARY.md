# T01: 115-tracking-corrections-and-api-acceptance 01

**# Phase 115 Plan 01: Requirement Tracking Gap Closure Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 115 Plan 01: Requirement Tracking Gap Closure Summary

**Closed 13 requirement tracking gaps from v11.0 milestone audit: WHERE-01..06, FRAG-01..04, UPS-01..03 marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md with Phase 106/109 attribution**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-25T22:16:13Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-25T22:18:36Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- All 32 v11.0 requirements now show [x] in REQUIREMENTS.md (previously 19 complete, 13 pending)
- WHERE-01..06 traceability corrected to Phase 106 / Complete (was Phase 115 / Pending)
- FRAG-01..04 traceability corrected to Phase 106 / Complete (was Phase 115 / Pending)
- UPS-01..03 traceability corrected to Phase 109 / Complete (was Phase 115 / Pending)
- 106-01-SUMMARY.md frontmatter now includes requirements-completed: [WHERE-01..WHERE-06]
- 106-02-SUMMARY.md frontmatter now includes requirements-completed: [FRAG-01..FRAG-04]

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes and traceability table** - `2c86f53d` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Add requirements-completed to Phase 106 SUMMARY frontmatter** - `d2cb7db7` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - 13 checkboxes updated from [ ] to [x]; 13 traceability rows updated with correct phase and Complete status
- `.planning/phases/106-advanced-where-operators-and-raw-sql-fragments/106-01-SUMMARY.md` - Added `requirements-completed: [WHERE-01, WHERE-02, WHERE-03, WHERE-04, WHERE-05, WHERE-06]` to frontmatter
- `.planning/phases/106-advanced-where-operators-and-raw-sql-fragments/106-02-SUMMARY.md` - Added `requirements-completed: [FRAG-01, FRAG-02, FRAG-03, FRAG-04]` to frontmatter

## Decisions Made
- Documentation-only plan: no code changes needed -- Phase 106 and 109 implementations were already verified correct (all E2E tests pass, VERIFICATION.md status=passed), only the tracking records were missing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All 32 v11.0 requirements now marked complete
- REQUIREMENTS.md is authoritative and fully accurate
- Phase 115 Plan 02 can proceed (API acceptance or next planned work)

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` verified present with 32 [x] checkboxes
- `.planning/phases/106-advanced-where-operators-and-raw-sql-fragments/106-01-SUMMARY.md` verified contains requirements-completed
- `.planning/phases/106-advanced-where-operators-and-raw-sql-fragments/106-02-SUMMARY.md` verified contains requirements-completed
- Task 1 commit `2c86f53d` verified in git log
- Task 2 commit `d2cb7db7` verified in git log
