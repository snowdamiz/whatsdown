  - 7 ORM boundary comments documenting why specific queries retain raw SQL
  - parse_limit helper for String-to-Int limit parameter conversion

key_decisions:
  - Inline let = case ... end not supported in Mesh parser; extracted parse_limit helper function instead
  - acknowledge_alert and resolve_fired_alert retain execute_raw because SET column = now() requires PG server-side function call
  - event_volume_hourly uses string interpolation for bucket in date_trunc (safe: caller validates hour/day)
  - toggle_alert_rule and check_new_issue verified as already rewritten by Plan 01 -- skipped
  - list_alerts uses Query.join_as with status passed 3 times for project_id + optional status filter
patterns_established:
  - parse_limit helper for all Query.limit call sites needing String-to-Int conversion
  - ORM boundary documentation format: multi-line comment explaining why raw SQL is retained, ending with Intentional raw SQL.
  - ORM boundary format consistently applied to all 5 complex alert queries (create_alert_rule, evaluate_threshold_rule, fire_alert, acknowledge_alert, resolve_fired_alert)

# S08: Mesher Rewrite Search Dashboard And Alerts

**# Phase 112 Plan 01: Rewrite Search/Dashboard/Detail/Team Queries Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 112 Plan 01: Rewrite Search/Dashboard/Detail/Team Queries Summary

**12 query functions rewritten from raw SQL to ORM Query/Repo pipe chains with 7 ORM boundary rationale comments for complex queries**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-18T03:06:55Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-18T03:12:05Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Rewrote 12 query functions from Repo.query_raw/execute_raw to ORM APIs (Query.from pipe chains + Repo.all/Repo.update_where)
- Added 7 ORM boundary comments documenting why specific queries retain raw SQL (parameter binding in SELECT, scalar subqueries, server-side now())
- Created parse_limit helper function for safe String-to-Int limit conversion with default 25
- Mesher compiles successfully with all rewrites

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rewrite search, dashboard, detail, and team queries to ORM** - `73ce2abc` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Compile and verify query rewrites** - `cf84cf75` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mesher/storage/queries.mpl` - 12 query functions rewritten to ORM, 7 boundary comments added, parse_limit helper

## Decisions Made
- acknowledge_alert and resolve_fired_alert retain Repo.execute_raw because SET acknowledged_at/resolved_at = now() requires a PG server-side function call that Map<String,String> cannot express
- event_volume_hourly string-interpolates the bucket parameter into date_trunc expression rather than using a bound parameter, since the caller validates it to only "hour" or "day"
- Inline `let x = case ... end` assignment is not supported by the Mesh parser; extracted parse_limit as a helper function following the parse_event_count pattern

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Mesh parser does not support inline let = case ... end**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Compile and verify)
- **Issue:** `let lim = case String.to_int(limit_str) do ... end` caused parse errors at line 474
- **Fix:** Created `parse_limit` helper function following the existing `parse_event_count` pattern; replaced all 5 inline case blocks with `parse_limit(limit_str)` calls
- **Files modified:** mesher/storage/queries.mpl
- **Verification:** `meshc build mesher` compiles successfully
- **Committed in:** cf84cf75 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** Auto-fix necessary for compilation. Cleaner code than inline case blocks. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None beyond the parse error fixed above.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All search, dashboard, detail, and team queries now use ORM APIs or have documented boundaries
- 33 remaining Repo.query_raw/execute_raw calls in queries.mpl (alert system, retention, auth crypto, and boundary-documented queries)
- Ready for Plan 02 (remaining alert and retention query rewrites)

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files and commits verified.

# Phase 112 Plan 02: Rewrite Alert System Queries to ORM Summary

**5 alert queries rewritten from raw SQL to ORM pipe chains with 3 new ORM boundary comments, completing REWR-05 and the Phase 112 alert domain**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-18T03:14:48Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-18T03:17:26Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Rewrote 5 alert query functions (list_alert_rules, get_event_alert_rules, should_fire_by_cooldown, get_threshold_rules, list_alerts) from Repo.query_raw to ORM Query/Repo pipe chains
- Added 3 ORM boundary comments for complex alert queries (create_alert_rule, evaluate_threshold_rule, fire_alert)
- Verified toggle_alert_rule and check_new_issue were already rewritten by Plan 01
- Mesher compiles successfully with all Phase 112 rewrites
- Documented complete raw SQL inventory: 28 calls in queries.mpl, 1 in writer.mpl, 2 in schema.mpl (DDL)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rewrite alert system queries to ORM** - `30235cff` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Compile, verify, and document final Phase 112 raw SQL count** - `8522fb01` (chore)

## Files Created/Modified
- `mesher/storage/queries.mpl` - 5 alert queries rewritten to ORM, 3 boundary comments added
- `mesher/mesher` - Recompiled binary with all Phase 112 rewrites

## Decisions Made
- toggle_alert_rule and check_new_issue were already rewritten by Plan 01 -- verified and skipped (plan anticipated this possibility)
- list_alerts passes status parameter 3 times to bind both position in (? = '' OR alerts.status = ?) plus project_id

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Raw SQL Inventory (Post-Phase 112)

Remaining Repo.query_raw/execute_raw calls by domain:

| Domain | Functions | Calls | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Auth (PG crypto) | create_api_key, revoke_api_key, create_user, create_session | 4 | Two-step pattern for PG functions |
| Issue (Phase 111) | upsert_issue, assign_issue (NULL), check_volume_spikes | 3 | Documented ORM boundaries |
| Event (Phase 111) | extract_event_fields, insert_event (writer.mpl) | 2 | Documented ORM boundaries |
| Search (Phase 112) | list_issues_filtered, search_events_fulltext | 3 | Documented ORM boundaries |
| Dashboard (Phase 112) | event_breakdown_by_tag, project_health_summary | 2 | Documented ORM boundaries |
| Detail (Phase 112) | get_event_neighbors | 1 | Documented ORM boundaries |
| Alert (Phase 112) | create_alert_rule, evaluate_threshold_rule, fire_alert, acknowledge_alert, resolve_fired_alert | 6 | Documented ORM boundaries |
| Retention (Phase 113) | delete_expired_events, get_expired_partitions, drop_partition, get_all_project_retention, get_project_storage, update_project_settings, get_project_settings, check_sample_rate | 8 | Phase 113 scope |
| Schema (DDL) | schema migration, partition date | 2 | Excluded from data query count |

**Total: 31 raw SQL calls (28 queries.mpl + 1 writer.mpl + 2 schema.mpl DDL)**

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 112 complete: REWR-03, REWR-04, REWR-05 all fulfilled
- 8 retention queries remain for Phase 113 cleanup
- All remaining raw SQL is documented with ORM boundary rationale or is two-step PG crypto pattern
