provides:
  - 4 retention/storage data queries rewritten to ORM (delete_expired_events, get_all_project_retention, get_project_storage, get_project_settings)
  - ORM boundary documentation for update_project_settings and check_sample_rate
  - DDL exclusion comments for get_expired_partitions and drop_partition
  - Zero unaccounted-for data queries remaining in mesher/ -- REWR-08 satisfied
  - Updated file header documenting all data queries now use ORM

key_decisions:
  - delete_expired_events uses Repo.delete_where + Query.where_raw for interval expression -- the interval arithmetic (? || ' days')::interval is expressible via where_raw
  - update_project_settings retains raw SQL: COALESCE with server-side JSONB extraction cannot be expressed via Repo.update_where Map<String,String>
  - check_sample_rate retains raw SQL: random() comparison with scalar subquery and COALESCE default not expressible via ORM query builder
  - get_expired_partitions and drop_partition excluded from data query count as DDL/catalog operations
  - All 24+ remaining raw SQL calls in queries.mpl categorized: 4 PG crypto two-step, 18 documented ORM boundaries, 2 DDL/partition
patterns_established:
  - ORM boundary comment format: multi-line before function explaining WHAT cannot be expressed and WHY, ending in 'Intentional raw SQL.'
  - DDL exclusion comment format: single-line in function comment noting DDL/catalog type and scope exclusion

# S09: Mesher Rewrite Retention And Final Cleanup

**# Phase 113 Plan 01: Retention/Storage ORM Rewrite Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 113 Plan 01: Retention/Storage ORM Rewrite Summary

**4 retention/storage queries rewritten to ORM (delete_expired_events, get_all_project_retention, get_project_storage, get_project_settings) + 2 ORM boundaries + 2 DDL exclusions documented, satisfying REWR-06 and REWR-08 with zero compilation errors**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-25T20:50:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-25T20:55:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Rewrote 4 retention/storage data query functions from raw SQL to ORM Query/Repo pipe chains
- Added ORM boundary documentation to 2 functions that must retain raw SQL (update_project_settings, check_sample_rate)
- Added DDL exclusion comments to 2 partition/catalog functions (get_expired_partitions, drop_partition)
- Updated file header to reflect all data queries now use ORM
- Verified mesher compiles with zero errors after all changes
- Audited all remaining Repo.query_raw/execute_raw calls: 24 in queries.mpl (4 PG crypto, 18 ORM boundaries, 2 DDL), 1 in writer.mpl (JSONB extraction), 2 in schema.mpl (DDL) -- all accounted for

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rewrite 4 retention/storage queries to ORM and document 2 boundaries** - `f63b151d` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Compile Mesher and audit remaining raw SQL calls** - no file changes (compilation + audit verification)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit to follow)

## Files Created/Modified

- `/Users/sn0w/Documents/dev/snow/mesher/storage/queries.mpl` - Header updated; 4 functions rewritten to ORM; 2 ORM boundary comments added; 2 DDL exclusion comments added; section header updated with Phase 113 note

## Decisions Made

- `delete_expired_events` uses `Repo.delete_where` + `Query.where_raw`: the interval expression `(? || ' days')::interval` is expressible via `where_raw`, making this a clean ORM rewrite
- `update_project_settings` retains raw SQL: `COALESCE(($2::jsonb->>'retention_days')::int, retention_days)` requires server-side JSONB extraction and fallback to current column value -- `Repo.update_where` only accepts `Map<String,String>` literal values
- `check_sample_rate` retains raw SQL: `random() < COALESCE((SELECT ...), 1.0)` uses a server-side random function comparison with a scalar subquery -- not expressible via ORM
- DDL/partition functions excluded per established ORM rewrite scope rules

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- `meshc` installed at `/Users/sn0w/.local/bin/meshc` could not locate `libmesh_rt.a` -- used the locally built binary at `/Users/sn0w/Documents/dev/snow/target/debug/meshc` instead (consistent with prior phases). Zero compilation errors confirmed.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- REWR-06 and REWR-08 requirements satisfied
- All data queries across Mesher now use ORM or have documented ORM boundary rationale
- mesher compiles with zero errors
- Phase 113 cleanup complete; ready for any remaining Phase 113 plans or Phase 114
