# T01: Added the M049 assembled verifier and wrapper contract tests, but the full replay now stops on the independently red M039 retained rail.

Implement the single assembled acceptance wrapper `scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh`. It should fail fast on public/docs/static drift, build `target/debug/meshc` before the direct materializer check, handle Postgres `DATABASE_URL` explicitly instead of assuming shell inheritance, replay the retained clustered and M048 wrappers serially, and retain one copied proof bundle under `.tmp/m049-s05/verify/`.

## Failure Modes

| Dependency | On error | On timeout | On malformed response |
|------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Postgres env resolution for `cargo test -p meshc --test e2e_m049_s01 -- --nocapture` | Fail closed before the S01 replay starts and name the missing env source instead of silently running with no `DATABASE_URL`. | Keep the preflight log and stop before long Cargo phases. | Reject malformed `DATABASE_URL` or unreadable fallback env files rather than leaking them into retained artifacts. |
| `target/debug/meshc` requirement for `node scripts/tests/verify-m049-s03-materialize-examples.mjs --check` | Run a cargo phase that produces the binary before the materializer check; if it is still missing, stop with a named preflight failure. | N/A — local binary presence only. | Reject wrong binary path or missing executable bit before claiming example parity. |
| Retained upstream verifiers (`scripts/verify-m039-s01.sh`, `scripts/verify-m045-s02.sh`, `scripts/verify-m047-s05.sh`, `scripts/verify-m048-s05.sh`) | Stop at the failing phase and point to the upstream log/bundle rather than papering over a historical regression. | Preserve the failing phase log and copied verify directory path. | Treat missing `status.txt`, `phase-report.txt`, manifests, or pointer files as retained-proof drift. |
| Fresh `.tmp/m049-s01`, `.tmp/m049-s02`, `.tmp/m049-s03` artifact capture | Fail closed if the replay produced no new directories or if the copied bundle omits expected scenario families. | Preserve the before/after snapshot and artifact-copy log for diagnosis. | Reject empty or malformed copied bundles instead of treating any non-empty directory as success. |

## Load Profile

- **Shared resources**: Cargo build/test outputs, `target/debug/meshc`, website build temp dirs inside retained wrappers, `.tmp/m049-s01`, `.tmp/m049-s02`, `.tmp/m049-s03`, `.tmp/m039-s01/verify`, `.tmp/m045-s02/verify`, `.tmp/m047-s05/verify`, and `.tmp/m048-s05/verify`.
- **Per-operation cost**: several cargo test targets, one direct Node materializer check, multiple wrapper replays, and copied retained bundles/manifests.
- **10x breakpoint**: compile/docs-build time and retained artifact churn dominate first; the task should keep the replay serial and avoid duplicating the website build or M048 internals.

## Negative Tests

- **Malformed inputs**: missing `DATABASE_URL`, unreadable fallback env file, missing `target/debug/meshc`, or malformed retained bundle pointer paths.
- **Error paths**: named Cargo filters silently running 0 tests, materializer check running before a built binary exists, or historical wrapper output missing required verify files.
- **Boundary conditions**: the retained bundle must include both fixed upstream verify dirs and fresh timestamped M049 artifact buckets; `m039-s01` is the older asymmetric case and should only be checked against the files it truly owns.

## Steps

1. Create `scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh` from the M048 assembled-wrapper pattern rather than inventing a new shell structure.
2. Replay the fast public/static phases first (S04 onboarding contract, mesh-pkg/tooling scaffold filters), then the direct S03 materializer check, then the expensive M049 runtime/parity replays, then the retained `m039`/`m045`/`m047` rails, and `bash scripts/verify-m048-s05.sh` last.
3. Resolve Postgres `DATABASE_URL` explicitly inside the wrapper and fail closed if no truthful env source exists; do not rely on inherited interactive shell state.
4. Snapshot-copy fresh `.tmp/m049-s01`, `.tmp/m049-s02`, and `.tmp/m049-s03` replay artifacts plus the retained upstream verify dirs into `.tmp/m049-s05/verify/retained-proof-bundle/`.
5. Assert the final `status.txt`, `current-phase.txt`, `phase-report.txt`, `full-contract.log`, and `latest-proof-bundle.txt` contract plus bundle-shape markers before printing `verify-m049-s05: ok`.

## Must-Haves

- [ ] `scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh` is the single assembled rail for R116 and reuses lower-level S01-S04 and M048 proofs rather than reimplementing them.
- [ ] The wrapper handles the Postgres env and materializer ordering truthfully instead of depending on interactive shell state or lucky prior builds.
- [ ] `.tmp/m049-s05/verify/retained-proof-bundle/` contains copied retained verify dirs plus fresh `m049-s01`, `m049-s02`, and `m049-s03` artifact buckets with fail-closed manifests/pointers.

## Inputs

- ``scripts/verify-m048-s05.sh``
- ``scripts/verify-m047-s05.sh``
- ``scripts/verify-m045-s02.sh``
- ``scripts/verify-m039-s01.sh``
- ``scripts/tests/verify-m049-s03-materialize-examples.mjs``
- ``scripts/tests/verify-m049-s04-onboarding-contract.test.mjs``
- ``compiler/meshc/tests/e2e_m049_s01.rs``
- ``compiler/meshc/tests/e2e_m049_s02.rs``
- ``compiler/meshc/tests/e2e_m049_s03.rs``

## Expected Output

- ``scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh``

## Verification

- `bash scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh`

## Observability Impact

Adds `.tmp/m049-s05/verify/{status.txt,current-phase.txt,phase-report.txt,full-contract.log,latest-proof-bundle.txt}` plus copied manifests that localize failures to one named phase and retained proof directory.
