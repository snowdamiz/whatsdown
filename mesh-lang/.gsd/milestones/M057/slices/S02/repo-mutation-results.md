## Canonical identity changes for S03

| Source | Destination | Final state | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hyperpush#8` | [`mesh-lang#19`](https://github.com/hyperpush-org/mesh-lang/issues/19) | `CLOSED` | Preserve docs-bug history under the language repo. |
| `/pitch` derived gap | [`hyperpush#58`](https://github.com/hyperpush-org/hyperpush/issues/58) | `CLOSED` | Retrospective product-repo issue for the already-shipped evaluator route. |

## Verified repo totals

| Repo | Total | Open | Closed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hyperpush-org/mesh-lang` | `17` | `7` | `10` |
| `hyperpush-org/hyperpush` | `52` | `47` | `5` |
| Combined | `69` | — | — |

## Bucket outcomes

- Still-closed shipped `mesh-lang` rows: `9` verified closed with their closeout comments intact.
- Reopened shipped `mesh-lang` row: `mesh-lang#3` is now `OPEN`, so S03 should treat it as active repo truth rather than preserved done state.
- `rewrite_scope` product rows: `21` verified open with rewritten title/body text matching the checked plan.
- Mock-backed follow-through rows: `7` verified open with truthful wording that keeps the operator-app/backend gaps explicit.
- Naming-normalization rows: `hyperpush#54, hyperpush#55, hyperpush#56` verified open with public `hyperpush-org/hyperpush` wording and only compatibility-path mentions of `hyperpush-mono`.

## Notes for S03

- The checked `repo-mutation-results.json` is an idempotence rerun snapshot from T02, so every operation is recorded as `already_satisfied` even though the canonical transfer/create mappings remain authoritative.
- Live repo truth has moved since the original S02 handoff: the transferred docs issue `mesh-lang#19` is now closed, and `mesh-lang#3` has been reopened.
- The org project still needs its item URLs/statuses realigned to the repo-truth state above; that board-only drift is intentionally deferred to S03.
- Re-run `bash scripts/verify-m057-s02.sh` before S03 mutates project state if you need a fresh live-read confirmation.
