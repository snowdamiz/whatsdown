# M057 S03 Board Truth Verification

- Verified at: `2026-04-10T20:06:05Z`
- Results artifact: `.gsd/milestones/M057/slices/S03/project-mutation-results.json`
- Retained verifier phase report: `.tmp/m057-s03/verify/phase-report.txt`
- Retained verifier summary: `.tmp/m057-s03/verify/verification-summary.json`
- Delegated S02 verifier: `.tmp/m057-s02/verify/phase-report.txt`

## Final verified board truth

- Total board rows: `55`
- Repo counts: `{"hyperpush-org/hyperpush": 48, "hyperpush-org/mesh-lang": 7}`
- Status counts: `{"Done": 2, "In Progress": 3, "Todo": 50}`

| Slot | Issue | Project item | Repo | Status | Domain | Track | Title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Done` | `mesh-lang#19` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpovuo` | `hyperpush-org/mesh-lang` | `Done` | `Mesh` | `None` | [Bug]: docs Packages nav link points to /packages instead of opening packages.meshlang.dev in a new tab |
| `Active` | `hyperpush#54` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpjg5Q` | `hyperpush-org/hyperpush` | `In Progress` | `Hyperpush` | `Deployment` | Hyperpush deploy topology: split marketing site from operator app routing and product runtime boundaries |
| `Next` | `hyperpush#29` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpjTg8` | `hyperpush-org/hyperpush` | `Todo` | `Hyperpush` | `Core Parity` | Hyperpush core parity: audit and harden existing Mesher ingestion and project/event model |

## Canonical mapping handling

| Mapping | Source board membership | Destination board membership | Destination issue | Destination item |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hyperpush#8 -> mesh-lang#19` | `absent` | `present` | `mesh-lang#19` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpovuo` |
| `/pitch -> hyperpush#58` | `n/a` | `present` | `hyperpush#58` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpoujA` |

## Removed stale cleanup rows

These previously stale cleanup items are now absent from org project #1, so the board no longer shows shipped Mesh cleanup rows as active roadmap work:

- `mesh-lang#3`
- `mesh-lang#4`
- `mesh-lang#5`
- `mesh-lang#6`
- `mesh-lang#8`
- `mesh-lang#9`
- `mesh-lang#10`
- `mesh-lang#11`
- `mesh-lang#13`
- `mesh-lang#14`

## Naming-normalized active rows

| Issue | Project item | Status | Title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hyperpush#54` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpjg5Q` | `In Progress` | Hyperpush deploy topology: split marketing site from operator app routing and product runtime boundaries |
| `hyperpush#55` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpjg5w` | `In Progress` | Hyperpush deployment: add a production Dockerfile and container startup path for the operator app |
| `hyperpush#56` | `PVTI_lADOEExRVs4BUM59zgpjg6w` | `In Progress` | Hyperpush deployment: create generic-VM compose stack and health verification for the marketing site, operator app, and product backend |

## Inherited metadata spot checks

| Issue | Status | Domain | Track | Commitment | Delivery | Priority | Start | Target | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hyperpush#29` | `Todo` | `Hyperpush` | `Core Parity` | `Committed` | `Shared` | `P0` | `2026-04-10` | `2026-04-24` | `Phase 2 — Parity` |
| `hyperpush#33` | `Todo` | `Hyperpush` | `Operator App` | `Committed` | `Shared` | `P0` | `2026-04-12` | `2026-04-30` | `Phase 3 — Operator App` |
| `hyperpush#35` | `Todo` | `Hyperpush` | `SaaS Growth` | `Planned` | `SaaS-only` | `P1` | `2026-04-20` | `2026-05-06` | `Phase 3 — Operator App` |
| `hyperpush#57` | `Todo` | `Hyperpush` | `Operator App` | `Committed` | `Shared` | `P0` | `2026-04-12` | `2026-04-30` | `Phase 3 — Operator App` |

## Replay and failure surfaces

- Re-run `bash scripts/verify-m057-s03.sh` to replay the retained S03 verifier end to end.
- Start with `.tmp/m057-s03/verify/phase-report.txt` to see the failed phase and drift surface, then inspect the last command logs under `.tmp/m057-s03/verify/commands/`.
- The delegated repo-truth precheck still lives at `.tmp/m057-s02/verify/verification-summary.json` and `.tmp/m057-s02/verify/phase-report.txt`; if that phase goes red, treat it as repo-truth drift before touching project rows.
