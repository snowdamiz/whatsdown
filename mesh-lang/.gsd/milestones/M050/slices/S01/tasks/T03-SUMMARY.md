key_decisions:
  - Keep the M050 preflight on direct source-level docs contracts and a single `.tmp/m050-s01/verify` bundle instead of replaying heavier wrappers or nesting another retained bundle.
  - Wire the active M049 wrapper to run `bash scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh` as `m050-s01-preflight` before the heavier scaffold/example/runtime replays.

# T03: Added the M050 docs-graph verifier, retained built-HTML evidence, and wired the M049 wrapper to run it as the first preflight.

**Added the M050 docs-graph verifier, retained built-HTML evidence, and wired the M049 wrapper to run it as the first preflight.**

## What Happened

Added `scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh` as the new fast, env-free onboarding-graph preflight. The verifier now runs the M050 onboarding-graph Node contract, the direct retained M047 docs-contract Rust targets, the production proof-surface verifier, and one real VitePress build; then it copies the rendered Getting Started, Clustered Example, Distributed Proof, and Production Backend Proof HTML into `.tmp/m050-s01/verify/built-html/` and proves the rendered footer contract from those retained snapshots. Added `compiler/meshc/tests/e2e_m050_s01.rs` to fail closed on the verifier’s command stack, phase order, bundle pointer, and built-HTML evidence paths. Updated `scripts/verify-m049-s05.sh`, `scripts/tests/verify-m049-s05-contract.test.mjs`, and `compiler/meshc/tests/e2e_m049_s05.rs` so the active M049 wrapper acknowledges `bash scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh` as `m050-s01-preflight` before heavier replays. The first live verifier run exposed a bug in my built-HTML extractor (`\s` double-escaped inside a raw regex), so I fixed the parser and reran the real verifier instead of weakening the proof.

## Verification

Passed `cargo test -p meshc --test e2e_m050_s01 -- --nocapture`, `node --test scripts/tests/verify-m049-s05-contract.test.mjs`, `cargo test -p meshc --test e2e_m049_s05 -- --nocapture`, and `bash scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh`. The live verifier finished with `.tmp/m050-s01/verify/status.txt = ok`, `.tmp/m050-s01/verify/current-phase.txt = complete`, a pass-only phase report, and a built-HTML summary proving `Getting Started -> Clustered Example`, `Clustered Example -> {Getting Started, Language Basics}`, and zero footer links on both proof pages. The bash tool did not expose elapsed times for these already-completed checks, so the verification evidence records `durationMs: 0` placeholders instead of guessed timings.

## Verification Evidence

| # | Command | Exit Code | Verdict | Duration |
|---|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | `cargo test -p meshc --test e2e_m050_s01 -- --nocapture` | 0 | ✅ pass | 0ms |
| 2 | `node --test scripts/tests/verify-m049-s05-contract.test.mjs` | 0 | ✅ pass | 0ms |
| 3 | `cargo test -p meshc --test e2e_m049_s05 -- --nocapture` | 0 | ✅ pass | 0ms |
| 4 | `bash scripts/verify-m050-s01.sh` | 0 | ✅ pass | 0ms |

## Deviations

Used `.tmp/m050-s01/verify` itself as the proof-bundle target instead of creating another nested retained-bundle directory, because this verifier already owns its logs and built HTML evidence locally and did not need to republish another rail’s artifacts.

## Known Issues

The current built `Clustered Example` and `Distributed Proof` pages still render some GitHub links against the old `hyperpush-org/hyperpush-mono` repo for example/readme references. The retained M047 docs contracts exercised in this task do not pin those exact URLs yet, so this verifier intentionally ignores that unrelated public-link drift.
